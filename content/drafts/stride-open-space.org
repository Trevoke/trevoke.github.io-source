#+DESCRIPTION: How we open the Stride open space
#+DRAFT: true

* Raise your hand if this is your first open space

* Welcome!

* Open Space
** Guiding principles of open space

*** Whoever shows up is the right people

*** Whenever it starts is the right time

*** Wherever it is is the right place

*** Whatever happens is the only thing that could have

*** When it's over, it's over

** Law of two feet
If at any time you find yourself neither learning nor contributing, you are responsible for using your own two feet and go somewhere where you will be learning or contributing

* Today's theme
The theme of today's open space is continuous improvement.

Today, I invite you to consider the following question: how do we bake continuous improvement into our work, as Striders?

* Agenda
In a minute, we will use these papers, these markers, and this wall to contribute topics to the conversation.
