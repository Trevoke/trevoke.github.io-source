You're always giving feedback - but you can control messages you send and check what messages you receive.

Recipe:
1. create an opening
2. Share your observation
3. State the impact
4. Make a request

1. "may I talk to you", "do you have a moment", etc.
2. what happened
3. how it made you feel
4. ask

e.g. tap on shoulder, "hey, music very loud. cannot concentrate. please turn down"

Observations, no interpretations. Things you see or hear.

Make a request: can be optional. Sometimes it can just be asking what happened, creating a conversation.

You may find that sharing the observation reveals that what you observed isn't what they did.

Book: "what did you say?"  - gerry weinberg  et al.

Think: what do you think people remember about your message when you give feedback?

List:
"power imposed by sender" (is this my boss?)
"are they trying to change me"
"emotional power of message" (angry? lots of words? nervous?)
"style"
"the actual request"

INTAKE elicits
MEANING triggers
FEELINGS activates
FEELINGS ABOUT FEELINGS evokes
RULES FOR COMMENTING directs
RESPONSES

and this is a feedback loop - can happen over and over.

What you say gets interpreted, which triggers an emotional response. Then you emotionally respond to how you feel.. And you then determine what you can and cannot say, which then creates the actual response (words, body language..)

"Think about all the feedback you want to give to someone, write them down, circle all the ones you want to say just to make you feel better, and don't say any of those."

If you want to give feedback.. And the person can't do anything about it.. Is it worth giving that feedback?

If something odd happens, try to think of three reasons why someone could have done this

When you hear things that don't map to your model of the world, you tend to discard it.


Feedback is not the truth about you - you can check, accept, discard... 

People who are less invested have less to lose by giving feedback

RECEIVING FEEDBACK
If unclear, check that you understand what they observed, what the impact was, and what the request is.
Set a reminder for the future to check in on that
You can control a little the format of the feedback you receive by asking questions to get to the observation/impact/request.
You don't *have* to honor that request right now if you don't want to.

OFFERING FEEDBACK
Biggest trick he's found: when offering feedback, speak about yourself first -- what was going on for you, then turn that into finding out more about the other person.
People don't like to be changed
Talking about yourself first can defuse a lot of anxiety
You can then find out what's going on for them
Ask for permission to give feedback - make it so that they can say no. Avoid "do you mind if", since we're conditioned to just say "no, of course", even if we mind.
Get to the point quickly.
Find good things that they do AND TELL THEM ABOUT IT so that when you have something else to say, the relationship is stronger.
Don't sell past the close


EMOTIONAL FEEDBACK
Find distance
Don't give feedback when you're mad
If it's really hard to say, in the middle of offering it, you can stop, say, "I'm confused, can you help me?" or "I'm confused, can we start over?"
You can talk about how you're feeling while you're giving feedback
You can talk about the pattern - if the behavior keeps coming up. Is it a single, pattern, or relationship
Crucial conversation + crucial conversations (good books)
If during the delivery of the feedback, someone does something surprising.. Check it out. Ask. "Hey, you're not finishing your sentences, your eyes are moving around a lot... What's going on?"
