# When to use a process

http://theerlangelist.com/article/spawn_or_not

Well, Iâ€™ve thought about this a ton. I started by basically copying erlmud ( http://zxq9.com/erlmud/ ) which tried to use a process for everything (room, item, mob, as well as connections between rooms and actions of picking up items).

Along the way I came across people who simply suggested that everything just be a data structure.

My current perspective is this:

1. Make it a process if you need to be able to handle a crash as an atomic unit
2. Make it a process if it needs to do work
3. Do not make it a process if you're just trying to store state in memory
