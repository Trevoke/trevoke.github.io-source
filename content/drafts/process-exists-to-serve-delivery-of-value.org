Process only exists to serve the delivery of value and you can only deliver value if you learn what value is therefore the highest priority is learning and the next one is delivering value. Process is only necessary to help deliver value and you should remove process if it gets in the way of delivering value.
Process is necessary when the environment doesn't encourage you to do the right thing.
Always try to arrange the environment. Process always hurts.
