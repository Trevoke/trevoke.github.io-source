#+DESCRIPTION: A perspective on successfully using Slack
#+DRAFT: true

* Slack: a way of life for… 2016?
Slack. Everyone's connected, all the time. The power is at your fingertips. You can post something, and others can respond. It's great. It's better than forums.

And then you realize that when you paste a link, it auto-inserts an excerpt. How convenient is that?!

And then there's giphy, and the world goes to hell.
* Problems
Slack is so damn convenient that people forget it's a communication tool.

* How it's been done before: IRC

* How it's been done before: MUDs

* Discipline? We don't need no stinkin'… Oh, wait.
