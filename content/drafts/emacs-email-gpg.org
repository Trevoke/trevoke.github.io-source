#+DESCRIPTION: Reading your mail with emacs
#+DRAFT: true

* intro
There are *excellent* tools for sending and receiving email.
Also, emacs, for all its awesomeness, is still essentially single-threaded, therefore fetching and sending mail might not be desirable.
In other words, I'm going to want to use emacs for things that *I* need to do, and follow the UN*X philosophy of using the right tool for the job.
So here's what the workflow will look like:
1. Retrieve email with offlineimap
2. index email with notmuch
3. use emacs with a major mode using notmuch
* install offlineimaprc
configure it
run it
* install notmuch
configure it
run it
* install gpg
get a key pair
keybase.io ?
