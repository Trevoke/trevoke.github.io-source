#+DESCRIPTION: Two students - did a slowish class, tryin

Two students - did a slowish class, trying to fix the magically-following fist of one of them, using some Systema drills. It did not feel quite right, but there was, as usual, some interesting mixed lessons from the Systema drills.

Isshinryu teaches these lessons differently, so if I'm going to reuse Systema drills, I'll have to be careful about it.
