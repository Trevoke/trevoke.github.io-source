 codebase is like a library and a programming team is like a librarian.
A good codebase is a library that uses the Dewey decimal system, and a good programming team is a librarian that knows the Dewey decimal system.
Also, the Dewey decimal system is XP practices. (duh :p)
As the library grows, it becomes literally impossible to find your way around without using some version of the Dewey decimal system. If your first engineer was named Matt, itâ€™s possible that the library is using the Matt decimal system, and that means only Matt can find his way around or even make changes safely.
