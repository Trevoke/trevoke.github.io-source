The MIM keeps 60 days by default. That may be too much for you..

By default, the folder C:\Program Files\MIM\config should make you really happy, it's got lots of plain text files with configuration for all kinds of settings.

cleanup.txt has "ARCHIVE LEFTOVER AGE (DAYS) := 60

Change that to whatever you feel is appropriate for you needs.
