#+DESCRIPTION: You'll notice, if you follow those screen

You'll notice, if you follow those screencasts (around now, anyway, as the plugin's code is likely to change, or maybe the screencasts themselves) that when you add in_place_editing, you suddenly get broken HTML..

The fix is thankfully easy!

vendors > plugins > in_place_editing > lib > in_place_macros_helper.rb
Line 79:
tag = content_tag(tag_options.delete(:tag), h(instance_tag.value(instance_tag.object)), tag_options)

Change to :
tag = content_tag(tag_options.delete(:tag), instance_tag.value(instance_tag.object), tag_options)

And you're set!
