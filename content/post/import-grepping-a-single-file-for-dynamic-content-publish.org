You can use xargs to grep the same word through different files. But how do you use xargs to grep different words through the same file?
Like this:

=echo "your fancy word finder stuff here" | xargs -i bash -c 'grep -n "{}" your/file/here=

Not something that's useful every day, but when you want it, hot damn is it nice to have.
