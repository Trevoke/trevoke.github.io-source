#+DESCRIPTION: If you're using Devise and rspec on Rails

If you're using Devise and rspec on Rails 3, and you want to override a controller, and you end up with an error that makes no sense whatsoever:

"Undefined method 'name' for nil:NilClass", well then, you probably want to add the following line to your tests:

@request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:admin]

Yeah... That took me way longer than expected.

On a COMPLETELY UNRELATED SIDE NOTE, pry is pretty cool when you end up having to step through code...
