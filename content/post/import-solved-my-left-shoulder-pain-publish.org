Is it a worrying trend that I write mostly about pain in here? :)

Every once in a while, usually while doing a high block with my left arm, I'd feel a pain in my left shoulder. It felt like a part was rolling over another one.. Muscle over bone, or something like that. It's not pleasant and is the kind of pain that stops your movement quite short and quite abruptly.

It happened yesterday while doing an uppercut (or, you know, punch to under the jaw/to the throat/etc). I realized my body alignment was wrong and my left elbow wasn't kept in properly. As soon as I fix that, I think, I'll feel a lot better about the whole thing :)

This of course begs the question.. What else am I not aligning properly, but maybe not quite wrong enough to get pain from it?
