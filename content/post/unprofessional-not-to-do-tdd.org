trevoke Do you guys have any idea how much *better* it is to do TDD?

trevoke But.. Like… Knowing that the code works and keeps working?
Having a small-footprint representation of the actual desired behaviour of the system?
Having constant feedback on the quality of the design of the system?

Running into problems you couldn’t even imagine and having a significantly accelerated learning curve?
Doing all this WITHOUT HITTING PRODUCTION?

trevoke I’m just speaking from personal experience here.. Just.. Writing some tests now to make sure that what I think is going on is what’s going on and guess what, *SURPRISE* it isn’t
And a bunch of those tests are kind of .. base-case tests so I can build up new tests on top of them
I dunno, it’s … Seriously, I think it’s unprofessional to not do TDD.
