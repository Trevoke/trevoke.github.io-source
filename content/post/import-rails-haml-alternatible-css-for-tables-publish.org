#+DESCRIPTION: If you've done any kind of table display 

If you've done any kind of table display in Rails, you've probably discovered the useful 'cycle' method:

<tr class="<%= cycle("even", "odd") %>">

This works after you've set two CSS classes between which you want to alternate - in my example, even and odd, because I have such amazing imagination. Come to think of it, to make my code more readable, it should be 'lightbg' and 'darkbg', or something similar. I'll fix that.

But yeah - how do you do that in HAML?
Piece of CAKE (in this case, it is not a lie).

%tr{:class => cycle('even', 'odd') }</tr>
