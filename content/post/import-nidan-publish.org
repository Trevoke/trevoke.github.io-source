Well, sensei hinted last month that maybe I should start gearing up for a nidan test. I've been getting used to being shodan, which maybe is a bad thing, but I haven't stopped looking for things I could do better. I'm becoming more sensitive to the muscles in my back, and I think my shoulders are finally beginning to open up...

So, I have something like 5 months to prepare.. Or, you know, whenever it turns out sensei thinks I'm ready. I'd better start doing more pushups.
