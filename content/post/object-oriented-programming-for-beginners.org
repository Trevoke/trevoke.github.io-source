1. No object should have more than three public methods (getters and setters count)
2. Everything else must be private
3. If three private methods are doing something similar, then maybe those are the public methods of another class
4. Never inherit
5. Always compose
6. Changeability is the most important thing
7. If you donâ€™t use good variable names, I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.
