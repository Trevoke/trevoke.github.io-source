On Monday I went to the dojo as usual, though I'd had a cold over the week-end and wasn't quite over it (I'm still not over it now..). During form practice, I was constantly correcting myself - I guess that goes to show I need to practice a lot more, if I dedicate this much mindpower to each form.. :)
