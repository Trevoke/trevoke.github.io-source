UPDATE!
Cowlibob did a fix, find it at  : http://github.com/cowlibob/rubyscript2exe


Untested!
From 'The Higgs bozo' on the ruby newsgroup. Apply change to both rubyscript2exe and tar2rubyscript. As far as I know that makes it work with newer versions of Ruby but I didn't get to play with it yet.
