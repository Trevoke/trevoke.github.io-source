#+DESCRIPTION: No class July 2nd - too close to July 4th

No class July 2nd - too close to July 4th, too close still to my class being canceled. Ugh.

One guy from meetup.com showed up, an old-timer, trained Isshinryu in the seventies. Good memories from watching his body, good guy, the old school will be useful in instilling the spirit in the class.

This was the first class where I reverted mostly to the way sensei taught the classes. A fair amount of calisthenics, all the basics, kicks, forms.

It went well. I liked it.
