Those two videos have been brought to my attention within maybe two weeks of each other, and I hate thinking of random coincidences.. So here they are, together so I can find them again in several years.

<a href=" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us-TVg40ExM">Playing for change: Stand by me</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfKdbWwruY">Where the hell is Matt?</a>

The first one fills my heart with a warm feeling - the song was recorded by all these people around the world simultaneously (or so they say, but it sure is well edited in any case).
The second one brings tears to my eyes, I'm not sure why.. I'll let you guys watch it
