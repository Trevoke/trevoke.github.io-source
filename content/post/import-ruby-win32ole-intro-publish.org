#+DESCRIPTION: [sourcecode]require 'win32ole'
ie = WIN3

[sourcecode]require 'win32ole'
ie = WIN32OLE.new('InternetExplorer.Application')
ie.Visible = 1
ie.navigate "www.google.com"[/sourcecode]

That's the basics for it. I found another basic intro from <a href="http://rubyonwindows.blogspot.com/2007/05/automating-internet-explorer-with-ruby_20.html">Ruby on Windows blog</a> .. And don't forget you can instantiate an object and then do something like..
[sourcecode]properties = ie.ole_get_methods[/sourcecode] to get more information. This comes in very handy :)
