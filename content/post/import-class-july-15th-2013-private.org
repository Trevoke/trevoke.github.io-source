Calisthenics, basics, form, kotekitai.

I very much want to bring in the Systema slow-and-smooth aspect of the training, but I need to teach it properly. So the question will be.. How.

The older student does Systema and combines slow-and-smooth with sudden and devastating, which is a great combination for fighting, but not a great combination for other students. He is aware though, and is working on it.. His style reminds me of Randy's, a bit like a bear or a lion.
