#+DESCRIPTION: Here are the things you need to know abou

Here are the things you need to know about using any new font for Rubymine:
<ol>
	<li>It needs to be <strong>Unicode</strong></li>
	<li>It needs to go into the $JDK_HOME/jre/lib/fonts directory</li>
</ol>
That is absolutely it. The last thing is the Monaco font, which <a href="http://trevoke.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Monaco.ttf_.zip">I have attached</a> for your downloading pleasure. It turns out DejaVu Sans Mono just isn't as nice -- however nice it may be -- and Inconsolata XL doesn't quite do it for me either.
