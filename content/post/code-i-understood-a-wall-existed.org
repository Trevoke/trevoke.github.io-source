Someone I worked with once said, "The code didn't demonstrate that I hit a wall, just that I understood a wall existed."

This colleague had been using the technique of Test-Driven Design (TDD) to methodically get the codebase up to a point where it could be refactorable and, at the same time, to a point where a problem with the current design decisions could surface.
He was happy because now that he was up to that point, the future decisions for the refactors were much more clear.
