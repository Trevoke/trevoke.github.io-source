> The idea that to be safe from online harassment a person has to make their account private is akin to the idea that to be safe from rape a woman should not walk home alone at night.

That's inaccurate. The difference is that being online is equivalent to walking around in a dark alley naked with both hands tied behind your back. And that's because that's how the internet was designed. You'll notice there's usually lights in the street, and most people don't choose to walk around naked with both hands behind their back.

If I were walking around naked with both hands behind my back and someone decided to slap me, I'd be frustrated,  annoyed and angry, especially because probably they'd do it from behind and I'd have no way to know who it was.

Oddly, then, what we seem to be asking is for some kind of code of war, where the enemy will present themselves, state their goal, wait until you are ready, then attempt to strike you down in fair combat.

So when someone decides to actually strike, the way people strike -- from the shadows -- we decide it's unfair and we shouldn't have to be in the shadows.

That's not quite right. The problem is a misrepresentation of what the Internet is.

20 years ago, you would never give someone your real name online. Do you know why? Because you're not safe online.

Today, you're still not safe. I don't know why people believe this to be different.
