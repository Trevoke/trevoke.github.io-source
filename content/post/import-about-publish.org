I am a program

In no particular order:

I am a programmer, with a preference for Ruby.

I am a practicing, studying, teaching nidan in isshinryu karate.

I also hold a rank of shodan in muso shinden ryu iaido, and have studied other styles such as jigen ryu, omori ryu, okuiai.

I studied Ch'iang Shan Pa Kua Chang for a little over a year.

And these are only the ones I've formally studied.

As far as physical, mental and spiritual development, I am a strong believer that there's only one mountain, and many paths up. Of course, no one is holding you back from making your own path - but remember that it's a ton more work
