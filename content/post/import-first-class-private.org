The first class went really well.

My teaching tempo is still pretty good, though I did underestimate how much information I was giving the new students. Next time, I need to make sure I don't overwhelm them, and keep them to a smaller set of basics.

This feels right. I know it's what I'm going to keep doing. Now I need to balance continued growth with proper teaching time. If I can do this twice a week, I'll have a good next step. For now, the current step is, getting once a week solid.
