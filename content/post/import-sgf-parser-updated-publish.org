#+DESCRIPTION: Someday I'll come out with a proper revis

Someday I'll come out with a proper revision numbering scheme for it.
I've implemented some <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> testing, the code now <em>actually</em> parses SGF files properly, including the KGS ones, it'll work on Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.1, so .. It's all good on that front.

The code's not as clean as I'd like it to be, and probably not as commented, either.

I am not -saving- SGF files with it yet, but heck if I'm not parsing them. And now YOU can, too !
