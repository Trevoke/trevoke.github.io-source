My answer : get Python! Someone wrote a handy program in Python that helps you out:
http://ntlmaps.sourceforge.net/
1) Download
2) change the configuration file (most likely just enter your username and password)
3) double-click on runserver.bat
4) make sure one of your environmental variables is http_proxy = http://localhost:5865 and the other one ftp_proxy = ftp://localhost:5865
5) use rubygems

Of course, if someone were to rewrite it in Ruby.. ;-)
