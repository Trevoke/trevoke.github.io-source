This week two more students tested. We have a new green belt and a new blue belt. They did pretty well, but I am completely amazed at how many excuses adults have. Their heads are full of them. Can't they just listen and say 'yes' like they were taught when they were kids? Talking back is a privilege, not a right.
Ooh.. That's good.. I'll reuse that.
