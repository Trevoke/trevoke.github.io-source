#+DESCRIPTION: No one showed up. I was angry. I did some

No one showed up. I was angry. I did some mild training on my own and then left early.

&nbsp;

Decided, afterwards, that if no one showed up, I could bloody well train on my own - and that I should just set my mind on what I am doing, instead of expecting them to show up.
