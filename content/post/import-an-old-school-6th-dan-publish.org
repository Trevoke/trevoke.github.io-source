#+DESCRIPTION: Yesterday evening a man who trained about

Yesterday evening a man who trained about as long as sensei came to train with us. Black obi, rather frayed to white. He'd trained a long time under his uncle, and then ~15 years under sensei's sensei. He'd taken a break for a while, so he was a bit out of shape, but his mindset, his attitude, his devotion were 100% into everything he did - an important lesson which I forget all too often.

He left, very happy to have joined us. I hope we'll see him again.
