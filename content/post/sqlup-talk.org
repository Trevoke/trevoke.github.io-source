* Sqlup.el : the story of the minor mode that could
Or, how Ι stopped worrying and learned to love emacs

Because, why spend five minutes doing something you can spend ten years automating?
* Short intro to me
I'm Aldric Giacomoni in meatspace

I'm Trevoke in cyberspace

Find me at trevoke@gmail.com

I study martial arts (this will soon makes sense)
** Emacs and me
Because everyone's origin story can be instructive
* Friendly manual to this talk
If you're just reading the slides, you'll see emacs functions.
Just use =C-h <function-name>= in emacs and seize the power.
* Short intro to modes
- One major mode
- Many minor modes
* The simplest minor mode
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-minor-mode miyagi-mode
  "Teaches you martial arts without you even knowing it"
  (if miyagi-mode
      (message "Wax on")
    (message "Wax off")))
#+END_SRC
* How sqlup started
- There is a Right Way™ to write SQL
- I'm *SO* lazy
- Can't emacs do /EVERYTHING/?
* Enter The Friend
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Oh sure, you just need a keyword list and you look back and see if the word is in the list.

— Eric Jones
#+END_QUOTE
At this point, I knew exactly *nothing* of emacs-lisp.
* Implementation for v1
This version took over the space and open-parens, and replaced the last word (emacs symbol, really) with its upcased counterpart if it was found in a list.
** =message=
It's Ye Olde Friendly Logger
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(message "Hello, world!")
#+END_SRC
** =thing-at-point=
It returns the kind of thing… at point… that you specify
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(thing-at-point 'symbol)
#+END_SRC
** =bounds-of-thing-at-point=
A cons cell with the buffer position for start and end of… Thing… At point…
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(bounds-of-thing-at-point 'symbol)
#+END_SRC
** =interactive=
This function is used to tell emacs that you're writing an extended command (=M-x miyagi=)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun miyagi ()
  (interactive)
  (message "Show me… Paint the fence!"))
#+END_SRC
** The meat of it
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq current-word-upcase (upcase (thing-at-point 'symbol)))
  (setq current-word-boundaries (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'symbol))
  (delete-region
    (car current-word-boundaries)
    (cdr current-word-boundaries))
  (insert current-word-upcase)
#+END_SRC
* Flaws with v1
- =insert= for space and open-parens
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(insert "a")
#+END_SRC
- limited matching capability (just strings)
* "Batch mode"
I added a function to capitalize SQL keywords in a region.
** =while=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (while
      true
    (message "Oh good, a `while true` loop."))
#+END_SRC
** =search-forward-regexp=
With =replace-match=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(search-forward-regexp "[[:alpha:]_]+" (point-max))
(replace-match "Miyagi!")
#+END_SRC
** =save-excursion=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; In Okinawa, belt mean no need rope to hold up pants.
(save-excursion
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (search-forward-regexp "rope" (point-max) t)
  (replace-match "belt")))
#+END_SRC
* Implementation for v2
Now sqlup uses a post-command hook, working directly with emacs' event loop.
** =post-command-hook=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; The fourth argument means "buffer-local" if non-nil
(add-hook 'post-command-hook 'do-something nil t)
#+END_SRC
Arguable choice. Runs ALL THΕ TIME. So, early guard clauses are imperative.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun sqlup-should-do-work-p ()
  (or (sqlup-user-pressed-returnp)
      (and (sqlup-user-is-typingp)
           (sqlup-trigger-self-insert-characterp))))
#+END_SRC
** =this-command-keys-vector=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun sqlup-user-pressed-return-p ()
  (equal 13 (elt (this-command-keys-vector) 0)))
#+END_SRC
** =symbol-name= with =this-command=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun sqlup-user-is-typing-p ()
  (string= "self-insert-command" (symbol-name this-command)))
#+END_SRC
** Oh yeah, also leverage =sql-mode= !
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(sql-add-product-keywords 'ansi '())
#+END_SRC
* Required tweaks for v2
** Only pull SQL keywords from =sql-mode= if not already defined
** Pull the correct keywords
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun sqlup-find-correct-keywords ()
    (if (and (boundp 'sql-mode-font-lock-keywords)
             sql-mode-font-lock-keywords)
        (mapcar 'car sql-mode-font-lock-keywords)
      (mapcar 'car (sql-add-product-keywords
                    (or (and (boundp 'sql-product) sql-product)
                        'ansi) '()))))
#+END_SRC
* Lesson learned
This looks so simple NOW.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun sqlup-maybe-capitalize-last-symbol ()
  (forward-symbol -1)
  (sqlup-work-on-symbol-at-point))
#+END_SRC

* Lesson learned
Wait, emacs can do WHAT?
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun sqlup-comment-p (line)
  (and
   (nth 4 (syntax-ppss))
   t))
#+END_SRC
Trust me. Write down =syntax-ppss= and look it up.
*  =syntax-ppss=..
Okay, so if you've looked up =syntax-ppsss=...

It doesn't work if the major-mode is not right.

So .... V3, coming next ........ Is a hack
* V3?! emacs is SO POWERFUL!
Here's the hack.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun sqlup-capitalizable-p (point-location)
  (let ((old-buffer (current-buffer)))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-buffer-substring old-buffer)
      (sql-mode)
      (goto-char point-location)
      (and (not (sqlup-commentp))
           (not (sqlup-stringp))))))
#+END_SRC
This is the implementation I'm *most* ashamed of.
* v .. 3.5 ? redis
I got a request for redis-mode support.

Luckily, redis-mode provides a list of keywords.
** Ze Code
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun sqlup-find-correct-keywords ()
    (cond ((sqlup-redis-mode-p) (mapcar 'downcase redis-keywords))
          ((sqlup-within-sql-buffer-p) (mapcar 'car sql-mode-font-lock-keywords))
          (t (mapcar 'car (sql-add-product-keywords
                           (or (and (boundp 'sql-(point)roduct) sql-product)
                               'ansi) '())))))

  (defun sqlup-redis-mode-p ()
    (string= (with-current-buffer (current-buffer) major-mode)
             "redis-mode"))
#+END_SRC
