#+DESCRIPTION: If you happen to use Gentoo on a Notebook

If you happen to use Gentoo on a Notebook, you may already know this. If not..

At the time of this writing, If you have a Poulsbo video card (another craptastic Intel invention) do _not_ upgrade to xorg-server 1.7. Stay on 1.6.5-r1 or whatever you have. If you upgrade, xorg will just refuse to work for you, and downgrading is kind of a pain.

If you have upgraded already, then here's what to do:

After doing this, you'll need to also mask &gt;xorg-server-1.6.5-r1, then re-install the old xorg-server, and finally re-emerge everything you have installed from the category x11-drivers.

Have fun!
