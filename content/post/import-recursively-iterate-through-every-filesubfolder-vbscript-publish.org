This is actually a lot simpler than I expected (gimme a break, this is my second foray into VBS!)


#+BEGIN_SRC vbscript
Set fs = WScript.CreateObject ("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

Sub ShowSubFolders(Folder)
        For Each Subfolder In Folder.SubFolders
                Set files = SubFolder.Files
                For Each file In files
                        WScript.Echo file.Name, file.Size
                Next
                ShowSubFolders Subfolder
        Next
End Sub

ShowSubFolders fs.GetFolder("C:\your\path\here")
#+END_SRC
