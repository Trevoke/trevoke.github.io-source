#+TITLE: Git : moving a remote branch
#+DATE: 2009-12-29
#+TAGS: git

One can't actually move a remote branch, but you can copy a branch and delete a branch, so...

Copy oldbranch in repo to newbranch.
#+BEGIN_SRC
git push {repo} {oldbranch}:heads/{newbranch}
#+END_SRC

Ex: git push origin foobranch:barbranch
renames foobranch to barbranch

Remove a remote branch: itâ€™s all about the colon:

#+BEGIN_SRC
git push <remote_repo> :heads/<branch>
#+END_SRC
[code][/code]

Example: git push origin :heads/some-branch removes some-branch from the remote repo (apparently git push origin :some-branch works as well).

This works for removing a tag as well:
#+BEGIN_SRC
git push origin :sometag
#+END_SRC
