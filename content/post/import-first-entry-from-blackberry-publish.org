This blog may yet come alive! I've figured out how to post to this from my Blackberry :) I use an app called bbmetablog (google for 'bbmetablog opencod'), currently version 1.2.2 . I had a bit of an issue getting xmlrpc line set up propery, until I changed their default 'xml-rpc?openagent' to 'xmlrpc.php' .. And I'm live!
